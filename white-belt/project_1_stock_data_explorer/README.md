# Financial Data Explorer

A comprehensive Python tool for analyzing stock market data, specifically designed for exploring Microsoft (MSFT) stock performance over the past 5 years. This project demonstrates key concepts in finance, statistics, and data analysis using pandas and matplotlib.

## 🎯 What This Project Does

This tool downloads, analyzes, and visualizes Microsoft stock data to help you understand:

- Stock price movements and trends
- Moving averages and their significance in technical analysis
- Daily return patterns and volatility
- Key trading signals (Golden Cross and Death Cross)

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Required Python Packages

```bash
pip install yfinance pandas matplotlib
```

### Knowledge Prerequisites

While not required, basic understanding of the following concepts will enhance your learning experience:

- Python programming fundamentals
- Basic statistics (mean, standard deviation, distributions)
- Financial markets basics (stocks, prices, returns)

## 🧠 Key Concepts Explained

### Financial Concepts

#### **Stock Price**

The price at which a share of stock trades in the market. We focus on the "Close" price - the final price at the end of each trading day.

#### **Daily Returns**

The percentage change in stock price from one day to the next, calculated as:

```
Daily Return = ((Today's Price - Yesterday's Price) / Yesterday's Price) × 100
```

#### **Moving Averages**

- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: The average price over a specific number of days
- **50-day SMA**: Average of the last 50 trading days - shows short-term trend
- **200-day SMA**: Average of the last 200 trading days - shows long-term trend

#### **Trading Signals**

- **Golden Cross**: When the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day SMA (bullish signal)
- **Death Cross**: When the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200-day SMA (bearish signal)

### Statistical Concepts

#### **Forward Fill (ffill)**

A method to handle missing data by carrying forward the last known value. In financial data, this assumes that prices remain constant until new information arrives.

#### **Histogram**

A visual representation showing the frequency distribution of daily returns, helping identify:

- Normal vs. abnormal return patterns
- Volatility (spread of returns)
- Skewness (asymmetry in returns)

### Pandas Concepts

#### **DataFrame Operations**

- `read_csv()`: Load data from CSV files
- `pct_change()`: Calculate percentage changes between periods
- `rolling()`: Create moving window calculations
- `shift()`: Move data points forward or backward in time
- `dropna()`: Remove missing values

## 🚀 How to Run the Code

### Step 1: Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install yfinance pandas matplotlib
   ```

### Step 2: Run the Analysis

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd stock-data-explorer
   ```
2. Execute the main script:

   ```bash
   python financial_data_explorer.py
   ```

### Step 3: Understanding the Output

The script will:

1. **Download Data**: Fetch 5 years of MSFT daily stock data
2. **Display Info**: Show data loading confirmation and row count
3. **Process Data**: Handle missing values and calculate metrics
4. **Generate Plots**: Create two visualization files:
   - `MSFT_Closing_Price_and_Moving_Averages.png`
   - `MSFT_Daily_Returns_Histogram.png`

## 📊 What the Visualizations Show

### Stock Price and Moving Averages Plot

- **Blue line**: Daily closing prices
- **Orange line**: 50-day moving average (short-term trend)
- **Green line**: 200-day moving average (long-term trend)
- **Green triangles**: Golden Cross events (potential buy signals)
- **Red triangles**: Death Cross events (potential sell signals)

### Daily Returns Histogram

- Shows the distribution of daily percentage changes
- **Center around 0%**: Most days have small changes
- **Tails**: Rare days with large gains or losses
- **Shape**: Indicates volatility and risk characteristics

## 🔍 Code Walkthrough

### Data Acquisition

```python
data = yf.download(ticker, period='5y')
```

Uses the yfinance library to download 5 years of historical data for Microsoft.

### Data Cleaning

```python
df.ffill(inplace=True)
```

Forward fills any missing values to ensure continuous data series.

### Return Calculation

```python
df['Daily Return'] = df['Close'].pct_change() * 100
```

Calculates daily percentage returns for volatility analysis.

### Moving Averages

```python
df['SMA_50'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
df['SMA_200'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()
```

Creates rolling averages to smooth out price fluctuations and identify trends.

### Signal Detection

```python
golden_crosses = (df['SMA_50'] > df['SMA_200']) & (df['SMA_50'].shift(1) <= df['SMA_200'].shift(1))
```

Identifies crossover points where trading signals occur.

```

```

## 📈 Interpreting Results

### Strong Uptrend Indicators

- Price consistently above both moving averages
- 50-day SMA above 200-day SMA
- Recent Golden Cross events

### Potential Reversal Signals

- Price crossing below moving averages
- Death Cross formation
- Increasing volatility in daily returns

### Risk Assessment

- **Low Volatility**: Daily returns clustered tightly around 0%
- **High Volatility**: Wide spread in daily returns histogram
- **Extreme Events**: Long tails in the histogram

## 🛠 Customization Options

### Change the Stock Symbol

```python
ticker = 'AAPL'  # Change to any valid stock symbol
```

### Adjust Time Period

```python
data = yf.download(ticker, period='1y')  # Options: 1d, 5d, 1mo, 3mo, 6mo, 1y, 2y, 5y, 10y, ytd, max
```

### Modify Moving Average Windows

```python
df['SMA_20'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()  # Shorter-term average
df['SMA_100'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()  # Different long-term average
```

## 📚 Further Learning
