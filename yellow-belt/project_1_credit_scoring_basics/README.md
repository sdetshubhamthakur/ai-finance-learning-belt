# 🏦 Credit Score Prediction Using German Credit Dataset

## 📊 Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning-based credit scoring system using the German Credit Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The system predicts whether a loan applicant is a good or bad credit risk using logistic regression.

## 💼 Business Context

Credit scoring is a critical component of financial risk management. Banks and lending institutions use these models to:
- Assess the probability of loan default
- Make informed lending decisions
- Minimize financial losses from bad loans
- Comply with regulatory requirements
- Optimize portfolio risk

## 📈 Dataset Information

The German Credit Dataset contains:
- **1000 loan applications**
- **20 features** covering personal, financial, and demographic information
- **Binary target variable**: 
  - `1` = Good credit risk (700 cases, 70%)
  - `2` = Bad credit risk (300 cases, 30%)

### 🔍 Key Features Include:
- Account status and credit history
- Loan amount and duration
- Employment status and income
- Personal information (age, marital status)
- Existing credits and guarantors
- Property and housing information

## 🤖 Machine Learning Concepts

### 1. 🔧 Data Preprocessing
- **Label Encoding**: Converts categorical variables (A11, A12, etc.) to numerical format
- **Train-Test Split**: 80% training, 20% testing for model validation

### 2. ⚙️ Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- **Type**: Linear classifier for binary classification
- **Advantages**:

Actual ↓
1 (Good)         124     15
2 (Bad)           25     36
```

### 🎯 Key Performance Metrics

- **Overall Accuracy**: 72% - Model correctly classifies 72% of all cases
- **Precision (Class 2)**: 67% - When predicting bad credit, correct 67% of the time
- **Recall (Class 2)**: 42% - Only identifies 42% of actual bad credit cases

## ⚠️ Business Risk Analysis

### 🧮 Understanding the Confusion Matrix in Financial Context

**True Positives (Good Credit - 124)**: ✅ Correctly approved low-risk applicants
- **Business Impact**: Profitable loans, minimal risk

**True Positives (Bad Credit - 36)**: ✅ Correctly rejected high-risk applicants  
- **Business Impact**: Avoided potential losses

**False Positives (15)**: ⚠️ Rejected good applicants (Type I Error)
- **Business Impact**: Lost business opportunity, reduced revenue

**False Negatives (25)**: ❌ Approved bad applicants (Type II Error)
- **Business Impact**: Direct financial losses from defaults

### 💰 The Cost of Errors

> **"False Negatives are costlier for lenders, as they lead to direct financial losses. Therefore, optimizing for recall on the 'default' class is business-justified in credit risk scoring."**

**💡 Why False Negatives Are More Expensive:**

1. **Direct Financial Loss**: Each false negative represents a loan that will likely default
   - If average loan = €10,000, 25 false negatives = €250,000 potential loss
   
2. **Opportunity Cost vs Actual Loss**:
   - False Positive: Lost potential profit (~€1,000 per loan)
   - False Negative: Direct loss of principal + interest (~€10,000+ per loan)
   
3. **Risk Asymmetry**: The cost ratio is typically 10:1 or higher (FN:FP)

### 📋 Business Recommendations

**⚠️ Current Model Issues:**
- **Low Recall (42%) for bad credit detection** - Missing 58% of risky applicants
- **25 high-risk loans approved** - Potential significant losses

**🔧 Improvement Strategies:**

1. **Threshold Tuning**: Lower classification threshold to catch more bad credits
2. **Cost-Sensitive Learning**: Penalize false negatives more heavily during training
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting for better performance
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create interaction terms, ratios, risk scores
5. **Class Balancing**: SMOTE, undersampling to address class imbalance

### 🎯 Risk-Adjusted Decision Making

**🛡️ Conservative Approach (Recommended):**
- Set threshold to achieve 70-80% recall for bad credit
- Accept higher false positive rate to minimize losses
- Implement tiered approval process for borderline cases

**💹 Business Impact Calculation:**
```python
# Example cost calculation
avg_loan_amount = 10000
profit_margin = 0.1
default_loss_rate = 0.8

# Current model costs
fn_cost = 25 * avg_loan_amount * default_loss_rate  # €200,000
fp_opportunity_cost = 15 * avg_loan_amount * profit_margin  # €15,000
total_cost = fn_cost + fp_opportunity_cost  # €215,000

print(f"Estimated annual loss from current model: €{total_cost:,}")
```

## 🎯 Conclusion

This credit scoring model provides a foundation for automated lending decisions. While achieving 72% accuracy, the low recall for bad credit detection (42%) presents significant business risk. The model should be enhanced with cost-sensitive learning and threshold optimization before production deployment.

The financial industry's risk-averse nature requires models that prioritize catching potential defaults over maximizing approval rates, making recall optimization crucial for business success.
