# Ai-Finance-Learning-belt Progression Tracker
A master repository for my journey to learn and build financial systems and software using AI.

## 1. Introduction

Welcome!  
This repository documents my journey to becoming an AI-native engineer, with every step focused on building finance and AI skills aligned with the Block Builder Fellow Engineer Fellowship.

Inspired by martial arts belt rankings, I‚Äôve structured my path from foundational programming (‚ÄúWhite Belt‚Äù) through advanced, production-scale systems (‚ÄúBlack Belt‚Äù). For each stage, I tackle real-world challenges faced by Block, using hands-on projects, detailed code, and ongoing reflections.

My aim: to demonstrate the technical depth, product mindset, and growth potential Block values in top fellowship candidates.

Progress is tracked in a dedicated **GitHub Projects board**, offering a clear snapshot of each phase, active project, and completed milestone.

**How to view my learning roadmap:**
- Visit [`/projects`] (https://github.com/users/sdetshubhamthakur/projects/1/views/1)
- Each card maps to a project under a given "belt" (e.g., "White Belt: Stock Data Explorer" or "Green Belt: Sales Forecasting")
- Columns show status: *To Do*, *In Progress*, *Complete*

**Roadmap Example:**

| Belt Level  | Key Project                       | Status          |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|
| White Belt  | Stock Data Explorer               | ‚úÖ Complete     | 
| Yellow Belt | Credit Scoring Classifier         | ‚úÖ Complete     |
| Green Belt  | Time Series Sales Forecasting     | üöß In Progress  |
| Brown Belt  | Explainable Credit Risk API       | ‚¨ú To Do        |
| Black Belt  | Graph AML System                  | ‚¨ú To Do        |

## 3. Linkage to Block Fellowship

Every project in this repo is **deliberately mapped to challenges Block faces in empowering small businesses and building responsible AI-native fintech.**  
- **White Belt:** Data cleaning tools and financial visualizations connect to Block‚Äôs need for actionable, accessible insights for merchants.
- **Yellow Belt:** Credit scoring and entry-level fraud detection align with Block‚Äôs microloan eligibility, fraud mitigation, and customer risk use cases.
- **Green Belt:** Time-series prediction and sentiment analysis power Block‚Äôs merchant sales forecasting and adaptive risk scoring.
- **Brown Belt:** MLOps and explainable APIs reflect Block‚Äôs commitment to production-ready, auditable, and trustworthy AI for payments and lending.
- **Black Belt:** Advanced systems (Graph-based AML, bias auditing) address Block‚Äôs large-scale security, fairness, and compliance ambitions.

The belt progression mirrors how Block evaluates real engineer growth, blending coding ability, business problem understanding, and product-driven decision making.

**Follow along and engage! I welcome feedback, ideas, and collaboration as I prepare to make a meaningful contribution to the Block Builder Fellowship.**
